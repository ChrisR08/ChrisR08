### Hi, I'm Chris 👋

After teaching myself to code whilst injured in the Royal Marines in 2018, I found a new purpose in tech. When the opportunity arose to attend a full-stack web development bootcamp, I eagerly applied — and in 2023, I graduated with a 100% grade, ranking 1st in a cohort of 262 students.

Now, I'm bringing my leadership, adaptability, and instructional experience from 13 years in the Royal Marines into the UK tech industry. With six years of hands-on web development experience — including two at agency level — I specialise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and PHP.

In my previous military role, I delivered mission-critical intelligence under pressure, solved problems in high-stakes environments, and mentored others to achieve their best. I now apply those same principles to building intuitive, accessible, and high-performing digital solutions.

I'm passionate about creating user-first experiences and committed to staying current with emerging technologies and best practices. I'm also eager to learn from more experienced team members as I continue my growth as a full-stack web and software developer.

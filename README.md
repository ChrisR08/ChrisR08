### Hi, I'm Chris!ðŸ‘‹ 


Having recently graduated from a full-stack web development bootcamp, I'm excited to add to my existing skills and continue towards a career change from the Royal Marines into the UK tech industry. I am currently learning PHP and the LAMP stack to add these essential skills to my web dev toolbox.

I'm eager to learn from more experienced team members whilst incorporating my problem-solving skills, determination, and adaptability into my new career as a full-stack web and software developer.

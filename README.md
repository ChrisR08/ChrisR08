### Hi, I'm Chris,

I started learning to code in 2019 while recovering from an injury in the Royal Marines. That led me to a full-time, UK government-funded full-stack bootcamp, where I ranked top of my cohort in 2023.

Since then, Iâ€™ve been building fast, accessible web apps using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and PHP, with a strong focus on performance, clean code, and SEO. While Iâ€™ve worked across the full stack, I naturally gravitate towards front-end roles where I can combine technical thinking with excellent user experience.

My background means I value teamwork, communicate clearly, solve problems under pressure, and learn fast, whether mentoring a junior developer or picking up a new framework.

Iâ€™m looking to join a team that values clean code, accessibility, and continuous learning â€” ideally in a React-focused role with room to grow and contribute across the stack.

I'm passionate about crafting intuitive, user-first digital experiences and am committed to staying current with emerging technologies, frameworks, and best practices.

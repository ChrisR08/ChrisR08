### Hi, I'm Chris!ðŸ‘‹ 


After teaching myself to code whilst injured in the Royal Marines in 2018, when the opportunity arose to attend a full-stack web development bootcamp, I eagerly applied.

Having completed the course in 2023, I am bringing my strong leadership, management, and instructional skills to the UK tech industry, honed through my 13 years of service in the Royal Marines. 

With six years of experience building and maintaining websites, including two years at an agency, I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and PHP.

In my previous role, I was highly skilled at problem-solving, delivering mission-critical intelligence to a deadline and adapting to new challenges.
I am eager to incorporate these skills into a new career as a web developer. 

I am passionate about creating intuitive, user-friendly and accessible online experiences and am committed to staying current with emerging technologies and best practices. 

I'm eager to learn from more experienced team members while incorporating my problem-solving skills, determination, and adaptability into my new career as a full-stack web and software developer.
